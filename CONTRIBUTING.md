# Laerx Contribution Guide

**BUGS:**

To encourage active collaboration, eCommerce Blog Extension project encourages pull requests, not just bug reports. "Bug reports" may also be sent in the form of a pull request containing a negative test.

However, when filing a bug report, your issue should contain a title and a clear description of the issue. You should also include as much relevant information as possible and a code sample that demonstrates the issue. The goal of a bug report is to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and develop a fix.

Remember, bug reports are created in the hope that others with the same problem will collaborate with you on solving it. Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of fixing the problem.

**Core development ideas or discussion:**

If you propose a new feature, please implement at least some of the code needed to complete the quality.

Informal discussion regarding bugs, new features, and implementation of existing features occurs in the comments of the issues filed using feature template.

**Which branch you should target?**

All bug fixes should be sent to the latest staging branch, i.e. development branch. Bug fixes should never be sent to the master branch unless they fix features that exist only in the upcoming release.

Minor features fully backwards compatible with the current Arduino release may be sent to the latest stable branch.

Major new features should always be sent to the master branch, which contains the upcoming eCommerce Blog Extension release.
